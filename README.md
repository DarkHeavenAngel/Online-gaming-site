Online gaming site

There will be a page with a list of games, with a search field by title, author, publisher and genre. It will be possible to sort the results by cheapest, most expensive, popularity and genre. Game pages with more detailed information will be implemented.
There will be separate pages for authors, where all of their available games will be displayed. The same goes for publishers, whose pages will display all of their released games.

Of course, it will be possible to register and sign in to your account. Authorised users will be provided with their own profile. In there, you can review your order history and edit your personal information. Authorised users can add items to their basket and then click ‘buy’ to place an order.
Additionally, authorised users can add, edit, and delete their own games.

Finally, there will be an ‘About us’ page with contact details and information about delivery and returns.
